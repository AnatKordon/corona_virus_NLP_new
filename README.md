This project is a final assignment in Advanced topics in Deep Learning Course

Authors: Itai Peleg, Anat Korol Gordon

In this project, we finetuned and explored various NLP techniques for analyzing COVID-19 related tweets.

# Download fine tuned models
You can find best models in this link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15cztgT7NYWh6qXfY8NOyUhsl0Speb8R8?usp=sharing 
Please download and add "results" folder to the project root directory (please make sure it contains two sub folders - best_models and best_compressed)

# Test our models with your own tweets
Want to test our model's performance? want to compare fine tuned models with distilled ones? You can do it interactively!
run our custom website we built using Streamlit package, generate a tweet and see how our models perform.
You can compare performance, as well as inference time
## How to run UI?
streamlit run ui.py
